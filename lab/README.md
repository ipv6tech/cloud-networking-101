# Let's Get started

The labs leverage GitHub Codespaces with Terraform plans to build out basic environments for each CSP so we aren't spending out time together doing click-ops provision of a base environment. By leveraging GitHub Codespaces we avoid spending time installing tools, polluting your laptop, and hopefully avoid the dreaded "works on my machine".
