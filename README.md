# Multicloud Networking 101

**_Networking to and inside the Cloud Service Providers_**

>[!CAUTION]
>_This repository is still a work in progress._

## Workshop Objectives

This full day workshop will lead you through a deep dive into cloud networking. As a participant, you will leave this workshop with knowledge of the necessary networking components required to operate a functional cloud environment with dedicated cloud connectivity. The workshop combines lectures with labs to provide hands-on experience with the course concepts.

This full day workshop combine lecture with hands-on labs.

Some of the things you will learn during the workshop include

- Overview and benefits of Internet2â€™s Cloud Connect service
- Use of Internet2 [Insight Console](https://console.internet2.edu) used to build dedicated connections to the Cloud Service Providers (CSP's)
- Networking components supporting dedicated connectivity for each of the Cloud Service Providers.
- Establish dedicated connectivity and route traffic between multiple clouds.

## Labs

>[!NOTE]
> As long as you clean up and delete the resources you build the cloud costs will be minimal for this workshop.

### Lab Requirements

It's helpful if you have some prior experience with _GNU/Linux_, [_Git_](https://gitimmersion.com/), [_GitHub_](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started), [_Terraform_](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials), [_VS Code_](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/getting-started), and _Cloud Technology_ but it's not a prerequisite to learn and have fun with the labs.

- Laptop with internet access.
- Access to Internet2's [Insight Console](https://console.internet2.edu/).
- [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) with access to run [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces).
- An account with each of the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) you wish to use during the labs.

>[!TIP]
>I strongly recommend a personal **free tier account** so you don't run into policy/permission issues with a restricted account from your institution.
>
>Consider creating a free-tier account using an email alias address, masked email or use plus addressing like `<email>+aws-training@gmail.com` for each account.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Free tier accounts will require a credit card but we will keep the costs to a minimum. In many cases the free services and credits your account will start with will cover some or all the costs. (With my accounts I've been able to run through the labs and keep the daily cost around 5 USD with each CSP.)

### Free Tier Services

As you build out your Free Tier accounts keep in mind that the terraform code for the Cloud Service Provider (lab) environments and the GitHub Codespaces are preconfigured to run in the US-East regions. If you are able to use those regions for this workshop it should simplify things.

> - [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free)
> - [Azure Free Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-services)
> - [Google Cloud Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free)
> - [Oracle Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free)
>
> _If you need help getting the free tier accounts setup, see the [Further Learning](#further-learning) resources below._ :arrow_down:

## Notes

**Google:** Before the workshop it would be helpful if you have your account setup, billing setup, a project for us to build into and Compute API enabled for the project. Send directions for these step to the participants ahead of the workshop.
