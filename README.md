## Abstract

This workshop will lead you through a deep dive into cloud networking. As a participant, you will leave this workshop with knowledge of the necessary networking components to operate a functional cloud environment with dedicated cloud connectivity.

The first half of the workshop will mostly be a lecture style workshop that covers the following topics:

- Overview and benefits of Internet2’s Cloud Connect service
- Tutorial on Internet2’s Insight Console used to build dedicated connections to the Cloud Service Providers
- Necessary networking components for each of the Cloud Service Providers.

The second half of the workshop will allow participants to get hands-on with their newly acquired knowledge and build connectivity to and inside the cloud service providers.

## Workshop Outline

This full day workshop will be split into two section, a lecture portion and a hands-on lab portion.
